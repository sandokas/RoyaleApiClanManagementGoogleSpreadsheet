RoyaleApiClanManagementGoogleSpreadsheet

This is a javascript Google spreadsheet that downloads weekly information about a Clash Royale clan. It supports donations and clan wars. 
That information can then be worked in the google spreadsheet as tools for clan management.

To use it you have to ask a key on developer.clashroyale.com for IP 128.128.128.128
This is because google spreadsheet will use different outgoing ips ranges and the key is IP bound.
To overcome this ip whitelist this code points to RoyaleAPI proxy.
